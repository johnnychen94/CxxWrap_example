# An example project of CxxWrap.jl

[![Unit test](https://github.com/johnnychen94/CxxWrap_example/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/johnnychen94/CxxWrap_example/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This is an example project to show how to integrate C++ and Julia following the guides from
[CxxWrap README.md](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/CxxWrap.jl).

This project consists of three sub-projects:

- The C++ library `greet`. This is just a normal C++ library project, it can be built as
  either shared or static library.
- The JlCxx interface library `greet_jlcxx`. This wraps the `greet` library with the C++
  part of julia interface [libcxxwrap-julia](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/libcxxwrap-julia).
  It is expected to be shared library. Usually, for any non-trivial C++ library `greet`, this
  part of codes are generated.
- The Julia package `Greet.jl`. This is just a normal Julia package that pass calls to
  `greet_jlcxx`. The calls are automatically generated by the Julia part wrapper
  [CxxWrap.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/CxxWrap.jl) based on the `greet_jlcxx` interfaces.

Dependencies:

  - `CxxWrap >= v"0.10"` is required (and thus `Julia >= v"1.3"`)
